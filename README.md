# Character Input with AutoHotkey
AutoHotkey script to automate the input of special characters like accents or math symbols

Initially used for typing characters with accents (such as resumé) without switching keyboard languages, I've extended the script to allow for any character you would like to type.    

Allows for LaTeX-like input in normal text inputs, for use in math assignments, or just for fun.    

Now you'll only have to look up the character you want once :) →↔⊤⊥∀∃⊨⊭¬∨∧≠
